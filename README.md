# Tic-Tac-Toe

This project was developed during the summer of 2022 as part of my efforts to enhance my understanding of the C++ programming language. It served as a practice exercise while pursuing the Codecademy C++ certification.
## Description 
 
This is a simple implementation of the classic game Tic-Tac-Toe in C++. Players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid until one player succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row.
